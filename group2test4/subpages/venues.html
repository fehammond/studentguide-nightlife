                    <h2>Pubs</h2>

                    <p>One of the well known pastimes of students is drinking. The UK has tonnes of pubs, all looking
                        for someone to claim them as their local. Manchester has an array of outstanding pubs and bars.
                    </p>

                    <p>An example is The Wharf. This large, warehouse style pub on the banks of Canal Basin. This large
                        pub has many cosy spots for you to relax in and have a drink or two, with a lively atmosphere
                        and bites to eat. The pub includes Vegetarian Friendly, Vegan Options and Gluten Free Options.
                        Another pub to keep an eye on is Sinclairs Oyster Bar. This pub is located in Exchange square,
                        right in the heart of Manchester's busiest shopping centres. This building has been around since
                        the 1600s, and its appearance clearly reflects such an era. This is a great place to go for a
                        drink after a long day of shopping! Finally, we have City Arms. This 190 year old pub houses
                        many real ales, craft beers and ciders. Its a small location but houses a beer garden and has
                        traditional pub games to keep you occupied while having a drink and a relax.

                    <h2>Clubs</h2>

                    <p>Students are known to enjoy clubbing, partying and having a great night out with friends. This
                        favoured activity has not gone unnoticed in Manchester, and many music scenes were started in
                        the
                        city.
                    </p>

                    <p>One pub with great atmosphere is Eden. This multi-storey establishment hosts floors of different
                        styles and feels. The top floors itself has three different club spaces, each with a separate
                        atmosphere. As well as this, it boasts its own on site karaoke. Another great club space is
                        South.
                        South hosts Local DJs and has been since 1995. This club has underground vibes, playing mixes of
                        90s
                        style music that include Rock and Roll and House. Finally, one of our more exclusive clubs is
                        The
                        Warehouse Project. Beginning in 2006, this club is based in an industrial warehouse in
                        Manchester's
                        outskirts. However, this club is only open from from September to New Year's Day each year.

                    <h2>Bars</h2>

                    <p>If you're not in the mood to go out clubbing, how about a simple drink? Manchester has waves of
                        great
                        bars and eateries for you to explore.
                    </p>

                    <p>Hard Rock Cafe has been around since the 2000s, opening in Manchester from the American chains.
                        This
                        bar and restaurant is home to an amazing atmosphere, with live sport and live music being shown
                        every night.. It also includes a selection of alcoholic drinks, including its own happy hour and
                        signature drinks. Located in the Printworks, it is always busy but hosts an amazing atmosphere.
                        Another location for those looking to upscale their evening is The Alchemist. This bar is host
                        to
                        Master Mixologists, offering bookings for "experiences" of their creations. The premise of this
                        evening may entice you into wondering, but the experiences are usually rarely the same. Finally,
                        if
                        you are looking for something new, how about Cane And Grain? This American-inspired bar has its
                        own
                        upstairs space for cocktails and other drinks of choice like bourbon and beer. Known to be
                        "carnivorous AND boozy", this location is great for a different experience at a great price.

                    <h2>Gaming &#38; Drinking</h2>

                    <p>However, if you're not a fan of sitting down, there are many other places in Manchester to have a
                        great evening out.
                    </p>
                    <p> If you enjoy movies, look no further than The Printworks, home to Vue cinema. This cheap but
                        high
                        quality cinema experience is bound to leave you mesmerised. There are many different films and
                        screens to choose from, and all are guaranteed to leave you on the edge of your seat, laughing
                        or
                        crying. This is a popular spot amongst students as it has a student discount on tickets. If you
                        want
                        a little more action, Breakout Manchester has you covered. With two locations in Manchester,

                        having a
                        great night out! Finally, with three courses to choose from, Junkyard golf is your one stop for
                        adventure and a drink to boot. These indoor games will leave you and your group in stitches,
                        especially if you get a few drinks involved. Each course has a slightly different feel, with
                        aesthetic choices being their main grab.
