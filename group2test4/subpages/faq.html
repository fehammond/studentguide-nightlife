                <h2>For my own safetey, what areas of Manchester should I probably avoid late at night&#63;</h2>

                <p>If you're in the city center, you should stay in a group of 3 or more. Areas with higher crime rates
                    aree: Castlefield, Piccadilly Gardens, Gay District and Northen-Quarter. Anywhere outside of the
                    city center its best to get public transport for london.</p>

                <h2>Which transport serviece should I use and does that change depending on the time of day&#63;</h2>

                <p>In the early evening you should travel by public transport as it is cheap and reliable. At night its
                    best to get a taxi/Uber from as neer to the venue as possible because trying to navigate the city
                    while intoxicated leaves you vulnerable.</p>

                <h2>How do I find out if a venue offers student discount&#63;</h2>

                <p>Check their website or simple ask on the night. Dont be suprised if you get an incorect answer from
                    the internet as certain nights have differnt policys.</p>

                <h2>What areas of the city center typicaly avoid a lot of tourists&#63;</h2>

                <p> The arndale and corn exchange are often mobbed with tourists and non-locals even the the area is
                    typical and boring. The better option would be the Northern Quarter and Ancoats because of its large
                    selection of cool and independantly run shops.</p>

                <h2>Are the nightclubs typicaly accessable for whealchair users&#63;</h2>

                <p>There are a large number of venues around Manchester that are accessable to wheelchair users but most
                    are not so if you are looking for that type of serviece please do you're research before you decide
                    to go out.</p>
